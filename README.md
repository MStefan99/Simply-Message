This project was developed as a way for me to learn about and implement end-to-end encryption myself.
Many planned features for this project aren't complete and likely will never be.

### To run the project
1. Install MongoDB
2. Install the dependencies using `npm install`
3. Register two accounts using the web interface
4. Add the accounts' ObjectIDs to the other accounts' `contacts` field. If you skip this step the contacts list will be empty when creating new chats
